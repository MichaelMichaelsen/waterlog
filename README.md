# waterlog
Waterlog using bootstrap and angularjs
This is just to try to use github in a small scale and to be more 
familiar with github to share the work.
The waterlog is just a simple tool to track the water consumption in our house.
The tool/app will be a tool running on chrome browswer and android.
